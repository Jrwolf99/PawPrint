# AOE Mosaic App

An app to simplify a technician's workflow.

## Description

ADTRAN, Inc. enables telecommunication service providers to deliver voice, data and video services to homes and businesses. Currently, two employees are needed to update AOE information: one on site and one in office. The technician on site must call into the office so that the infromation can be manually updated in AOE. This application will stylistically match ADTRAN’s software suite and interface with their system to allow operators to remotely register and replace a client’s ONT and turn-up their data service.
